# jsProjects

This repository contains multiple JavaScript projects that I am working on. Each project is designed to showcase various skills in JavaScript, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and building interactive features. New projects will be added regularly as I continue to learn and improve my JavaScript skills.

## Projects

### 1. **Responsive Navbar**
   A simple, mobile-friendly responsive navigation bar. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic navbar that adjusts its layout based on screen size.

### 2. **StopWatch**
   A basic stopwatch application. It includes the ability to start, stop, and reset the timer. The project demonstrates the use of `setInterval`, `clearInterval`, and event handling in JavaScript.

### 3. **Counter**
   A simple counter app where users can increment, decrement, or reset a counter value. The project showcases basic DOM manipulation and event listeners.

### 4. **ColorFlipper**
   A fun project that generates a random color every time the user clicks a button. The project focuses on changing styles dynamically and handling button clicks.

### 5. **To-Do List**
   A to-do list application where users can add, mark as completed, and delete tasks. This project highlights the use of JavaScript for managing dynamic content and user interactions.

   **Live View:** [To-Do List](https://todolist-sand-six.vercel.app/)

### 6. **Weather App**
   My first project integrating an API! This weather app fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can search for a city to view its temperature, sunrise, sunset, wind speed, and more.

### 7. **Tip Calculator** *(New Project)*
   A simple tip calculator that allows users to input their bill amount and tip percentage to calculate the total tip amount. This project demonstrates basic form handling, input validation, and simple arithmetic operations in JavaScript.
