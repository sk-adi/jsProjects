# jsProjects

This repository contains multiple JavaScript projects that I am working on. Each project is designed to showcase various skills in JavaScript, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and building interactive features. New projects will be added regularly as I continue to learn and improve my JavaScript skills.

## Projects

### 1. **Responsive Navbar**
   A simple, mobile-friendly responsive navigation bar. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic navbar that adjusts its layout based on screen size.

### 2. **StopWatch**
   A basic stopwatch application. It includes the ability to start, stop, and reset the timer. The project demonstrates the use of `setInterval`, `clearInterval`, and event handling in JavaScript.

### 3. **Counter**
   A simple counter app where users can increment, decrement, or reset a counter value. The project showcases basic DOM manipulation and event listeners.

### 4. **ColorFlipper**
   A fun project that generates a random color every time the user clicks a button. The project focuses on changing styles dynamically and handling button clicks.

### 5. **To-Do List**
   A to-do list application where users can add, mark as completed, and delete tasks. This project highlights the use of JavaScript for managing dynamic content and user interactions.

### 6. **Weather App**
   My first project integrating an API! This weather app fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can search for a city to view its temperature, sunrise, sunset, wind speed, and more.
